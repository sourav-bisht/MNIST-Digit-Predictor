# MNIST Digit Predictor

This is a simple web application that predicts handwritten digits using a trained model based on the MNIST dataset. Built with Streamlit, it allows users to upload an image of a digit and get a prediction in real-time. The model achieves an impressive accuracy of 98.5%.

## Features
- **Real-Time Digit Prediction**: Upload an image of a digit (0-9), and the app will predict the number with high accuracy.
- **Image Preprocessing**: Uploaded images are resized and converted to grayscale to match the MNIST modelâ€™s requirements.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with Streamlit for a responsive and interactive experience.

## Model
The model is a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on the MNIST dataset, achieving an accuracy of 98.5%. The MNIST dataset contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of handwritten digits (0-9).
